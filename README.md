### What is this?
This is a Fork of MKXP-Z which in of itself is a Fork of Ancurio's MKXP, merged with a mixture of contributions from RKevin/MelodyRS's ModShot, which itself a fork of MKXP-OneShot.
My aim with this fork is to re-generalize certain aspects of MKXP-Z-ModShot for other non OneShot mods while keeping the steroid functionality offered in the parent fork.
Also with the generalization still contribute personalized features for my current MKXP project that requires the extra tools.
#### Why worldengine?
WorldEngine is the name of my RGSS stock script replacement that is powered by worldengine-mkxp-z.
Currently that project hinges on the use of the VX-Ace editor for its map format but in the future will likely migrate to Luminol.

WorldEngine was made in response to 5 years of agony fighting the RPGMaker scriptbase, and is purpose is to provide creative freedom to make games in MKXP without trying to also conforming to the RGSS Scripts or even being compatible at all with them.
WorldEngine-MKXP-Z will still work as a drag amd drop replacement for RGSS projects, but the scripts its used for 
(which may possibly get packaged into this repository in the future on completion)
are on their own incompatible with replacing a RPGMaker Projects scripts, and could not be used with maps from a normal RPGMakerXP/VX project.

### What's new in this fork?
- ModWindow.borderless
- BorderlessDefault & TransparentDefault options in MKXP.json

### OG Description:
This is a fork of mkxp-z that contains (most) of the functionality of modshot/mkxp-oneshot. There is some missing modshot functionality but it SHOULD be a drag and drop replacement with no crashes. Please file an issue if you encounter a crash!

Feel free to use this in place of modshot, but do be aware that this is aimed more at fading memory so you might have to do some configuration to get it working right.

#### What doesn't work like modshot

**Most* of modshot's functionality is here, but some of it *isn't*. Stuff that isn't ported from modshot have dummy functions so your game won't crash, but they won't do anything.

What's stubbed out:
- Crossfading (Too complex, feature in modshot was quite broken, decided not to port it)

What's not here:
- Easy shaders (Planned, but nobody used the feature in modshot because of how experimental it is)
- FMOD (Various reasons, please use the libfmod gem instead)
- CRT shader applied to sprites (There are no methods for this because nobody used the feature)
- Notifications/Tray icons (Not ported because it's specific to Windows, and nobody used it)

What's *kinda* here:
- Input::KEY_* (Grafted on top of mkxp-z for compatibility and so your game doesn't crash. But you should migrate to mkxp-z's input methods)
- OpenAL audio filters
- The weird extra modshot buttons
- The oneshot-style keybind meny

</b></p>

I don't like the idea of doing straight "releases" anymore, since mkxp-z was never something I considered 'stable' to begin with, and the way I have to do things usually means I don't get to have things stress-tested until a build has already been posted and I eventually find out something is wrong. Automated builds are retained for 60 days and require logging in to access. Past that, you're probably on your own (though I've tried to make sure that building mkxp-z yourself is [as easy as possible](https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z/wiki/Compilation))

I'm usually *very* slow with responding to things on Github, so if you have something you want to say and you want a faster response, you're probably better off asking in [Ancurio's Discord server](https://discord.gg/A8xHE8P). I don't have my own.
The place is basically a ghost town haunted by myself and a few others, so expect me to pipe up if no one else does. I do not currently frequent anyplace else that you might care about.

I wouldn't expect too much activity from me from now on. I'm basically quitting, but I'm still willing to answer questions, take pull requests, that kind of thing. I'm still willing to hunt down bugs, but given the vast majority of my past troubleshooting came from trying to search through forum threads and snooping through Discord logs, chances are that if it's not something that I just broke, it's probably not a thing that I have the resources or help to fix. I'm not doing second-hand customer service anymore.

This is a fork of mkxp intended to be a little more than just a barebones recreation of RPG Maker. The original goal was successfully running games based on Pokemon Essentials, which is notoriously dependent on Windows APIs. I'd consider that mission accomplished.

Despite the fact that it was made with Essentials games in mind, there is nothing connected to it contained in this repository, and it should still be compatible with anything that runs in the upstream version of MKXP. You can think of it as MKXP but a bit supercharged --  it should be able to run all but the most demanding of RGSS projects, given a bit of porting work.

It supports Windows, Linux (x86, ARM, and POWER), and both Intel and Apple Silicon versions of macOS.

mkxp-z is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2+. However, if you build mkxp-z with the `enable-https` option turned on (which is the default), you will also need to comply with OpenSSL's Apache v2 license, which in practice means that the resulting binaries are licensed under GPLv3.

## Bindings
Bindings provide the glue code for an interpreted language environment to run game scripts in. mkxp-z focuses on MRI and as such the mruby and null bindings are not included.

## Midi music

mkxp doesn't come with a soundfont by default, so you will have to supply it yourself (set its path in the config). Playback has been tested and should work reasonably well with all RTP assets.

You can use this public domain soundfont: [GMGSx.sf2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxdvoxxcexsvn43/GMGSx.sf2?dl=0)

## macOS Controller Support

Binding controller buttons on macOS is slightly different depending on which version you are running. Binding specific buttons requires different versions of the operating system:

+ **Thumbstick Button (L3/R3, LS/RS, L↓/R↓)**: macOS Mojave 10.14.1+
+ **Start/Select (Options/Share, Menu/Back, Plus/Minus)**: macOS Catalina 10.15+
+ **Home (Guide, PS)**: macOS Big Sur 11.0+

Technically, while SDL itself might support these buttons, the keybinding menu had to be rewritten in Cocoa in a hurry, as switching away from native OpenGL broke the original keybinding menu. (ANGLE is used instead, to prevent crashing on Apple Silicon releases of macOS, and to help mkxp switch to Metal)

## Fonts

In the RMXP version of RGSS, fonts are loaded directly from system specific search paths (meaning they must be installed to be available to games). Because this whole thing is a giant platform-dependent headache, Ancurio decided to implement the behavior Enterbrain thankfully added in VX Ace: loading fonts will automatically search a folder called "Fonts", which obeys the default searchpath behavior (ie. it can be located directly in the game folder, or an RTP).

If a requested font is not found, no error is generated. Instead, a built-in font is used. By default, this font is Terminus.

## What doesn't work

* wma audio files
* Creating Bitmaps with sizes greater than your hardware's texture size limit.
  * To find the limit of various GPU's, [the OpenGL Hardware Database](https://opengl.gpuinfo.org/displaycapability.php?name=GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE) is useful.
  * Modern GPU's tend to have a limit of 32 kibipixels for NVIDIA, 16 kibipixels for AMD, Intel, Apple, and LLVMpipe, and 8 kibipixels for Mali and PowerVR. You should check the above database to be sure.
  * There is an exception to this, called *mega surface*. When a Bitmap bigger than the texture limit is created from a file, it is not stored in VRAM, but regular RAM. Its sole purpose is to be used as a tileset bitmap. Any other operation to it (besides blitting to a regular Bitmap) will result in an error.
 
## Notable Thanks

+ Ancurio, who wrote mkxp in the first place
+ Savordez and Aeodyn for making stuff work on Windows
+ Eblo for the `Graphics.play_movie` implementation
+ basically anyone else with commits in here or that reported problems to me
